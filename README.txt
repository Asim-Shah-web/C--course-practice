# C++ Practice Repository üöÄ

Welcome to my C++ Practice Repository! This is a comprehensive collection of my C++ programming journey during the first two semesters of my undergraduate studies. It includes concepts ranging from basic syntax to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This repository reflects my consistent hands-on learning, practice, and understanding of core C++ concepts.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders and files based on major C++ topics and levels of complexity. Here's an overview:

### 1. **Basics**
- Input/Output operations
- Data types and variables
- Operators and expressions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

### 2. **Functions**
- Function declaration and definition
- Function overloading
- Recursive functions
- Parameter passing (by value and reference)

### 3. **Arrays and Strings**
- One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
- String manipulation
- Character arrays vs. `string` class

### 4. **Pointers and Dynamic Memory**
- Pointer basics
- Pointer arithmetic
- Dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`)
- Pointers and arrays

### 5. **Structures and File Handling**
- Structure declaration and usage
- Arrays of structures


### 6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and destructors
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical)
- Polymorphism (compile-time and runtime)
- Operator overloading

## ‚úÖ Highlights

- Clean and modular code with comments
- Practice of both theory and implementation
- Real-world style examples and problem-solving
- Each topic contains multiple examples and mini-programs
